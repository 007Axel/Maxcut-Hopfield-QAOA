# Maxcut-Hopfield-QAOA
Multiple approaches to solving the Maxcut problem with a zero/nonzero B, later constraints (wip) using hopfield networks, variational quantum eigensolvers, and the QAOA ansatz. 

Essentially the idea is to find out if hopfield networks allow for solutions near the optimum, same for quantum algorithms for optimization, so engineers can make the right choice between both for their given choice of problem. In this case, we are considering Maxcut as an initial example.
